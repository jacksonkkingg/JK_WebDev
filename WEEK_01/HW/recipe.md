# Raw Cinnamon Rolls

## Dough
- 1/4 cup psyllium husk
- 2/3 cup water
- 2 cups organic rolled oats
- 1/2 cup pecans
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 2 tsp vanilla bean paste/extract
- Dash of salt

## Filling
- 10 large pitted dates
- 1/2 cup pecans 
- 1/4 cup water
- 3.5 tsp ceylon cinnamon/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp vanilla bean paste/extract
- Dash of salt

### Instructions

1. Soak 1/4 cup of psyllium husk in 2/3 cup water in a small bowl and stir to combine. Let sit for 5-10 minutes to thicken.
2. In a high powered blender, blend up the 2 cups of rolled oats til it turns to flour. Add in 1/2 cup pecans and blend again for another 10 seconds til a fine powder forms. Don't over blend or else you will make pecan butter, but you want the oats and flour to be finely processed as possible.
3. Add the oat/ pecan flour to a food processor along with the soaked psyllium husk, maple syrup, vanilla extract and dash of salt. Blend for about 15 seconds until a dough ball forms.
4. Scrape out the dough from the food processor and form into a ball. Roll out the dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper using a rolling pin. Shape it into a rectangle approx .5 inch thick.
5. Make the filling next- add the 10 pitted dates to the food processor and blend up til a ball forms, or until the dates are mashed up. Add in the pecans and process again for another 30 seconds to crush up the pecans into small bits. Add in the cinnamon, vanilla and water and blend up again until a smooth paste forms.
7. Spread out the filling onto the dough in an even layer, leave about 2 inches of dough uncovered at one end. Sprinkle a couple more tbsp of pecan pieces onto the filling.
8. Roll up the dough from one side with the help of the parchment paper into a log. Try to roll as tightly as possible without breaking the dough. Gently squeeze the edge closed. Refrigerate for 30 minutes before slicing into pieces. Store in the fridge.
